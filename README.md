# CameraCalibration-PointDetectionAndDescription-MultiView3DRecon

The current project aims to obtain a 3D reconstruction of a scene by applying three main stages, thus, the description of the reconstruction process is described also into three different sections, which include camera calibration, scene definition according to feature points analysis and 3D points cloud reconstruction and refinement according to multiple views of the scene taken from the same camera.
